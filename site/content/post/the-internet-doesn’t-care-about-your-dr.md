  Today I was looking forward to sitting down and working more on Zerto DR into
  Azure. I had my schedule (and more importantly my mind) clear and ready to go.
  I woke up checked email, shuttled the kiddos off to school and grabbed a bite.
  Everything was ready!


  Wrong!


  Nothing was ready, EVERYTHING was red! <sigh> It looks like the internet is
  down. Depending on what’s running there is always a little bit of clean up and
  I wasn’t looking forward to that at all...
